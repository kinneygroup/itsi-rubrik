### Services
Rubrik monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of system performance:

1. RubrikCluster
    * Description: Represents individual nodes within the Rubrik Cluster.
2. Storage
    * Description: Manages disk health and capacity utilization within a node.
3. Network
    * Description: Manages network throughput and latency within a node.
4. Compute
    * Description: Manages CPU and memory usage within a node.
5. Security
    * Description: Manages access and audit logs within a node.

### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, the Cluster service is dependent on the Nodes service. Similarly, Nodes rely on various subsystems like Storage, Network, Compute, Services, and Security to function properly.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as Nodes depending on Storage, Network, Compute, Services, and Security, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
